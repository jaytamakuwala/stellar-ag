    question: "How does the 7 day trial work?",
    answer: `You are entitled to one FREE 7 day trial. You can cancel anytime within your trial period with no obligations. If you go past 7 days without cancelling, your account will be automatically billed. All sales are final. Your trial is on a general calendar schedule. Please note: If you choose to upgrade to the Pro or Annual plan within your free trial period, you will forfeit that option and be charged for upgrading. We do not provide a free trial period for Pro and Annual plans.`,

You can upgrade from a Standard Plan to a Pro Plan subscription as well as downgrade from a Pro Plan to a Standard Plan subscription. The amount due for a new subscription will automatically be prorated based on the amount of days used. If you need help upgrading your subscription, you can contact our billing department at support@stellartrade.ai.`,
